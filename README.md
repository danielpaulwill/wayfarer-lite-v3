# Wayfarer

## Full game release date: July 1, 2023

Welcome to Wayfarer. A multiple choice mystery RPG with some shocking twists and turns.

The game's current state is mainly structural. It has the structure and foundation that will be used in the final game, but the current data and adventure options are placeholders for the true storyline to come later.
